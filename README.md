# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
An analysis of the school district was completed and supplied to the school board.  The analysis contains summaries based on school type, school size, school spending, and scores by grade.  The school board believes the data file provided for the analysis shows evidence of dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have asked for the math and reading scores for Thomas High School to be replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.  The school district analysis was repeated with the updated dataset to determine the affect on the overall analysis.
